Bobbel flowchart is a piece of software to show a flowchart in a browser. You can design nodes individually, link them and also create your own layout.

This software is in a early state and not for production use. We have a lot of ideas to realize and have to do a lot of testing. We hope you have time to check out this flowchart software and you will find them usefull for future. Any respone are welcome.
